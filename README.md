# PacmanClone
An imperfect clone of the famous game Pacman.

## Dependency
This game was made using the [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML) library.

### Current State
This repository is no longer being maintained as I have no interest in Game Development.

Then why is this repo still live? Because, I've put quite a lot of time and effort into all the code written so far and want to keep this open for others to add to or fork as a template.
